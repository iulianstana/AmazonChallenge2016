Amazon 2016 Challenge.

It's a sokoban like game with some new rules/ a dirty robot that moves the
boxes. Also the program need to be written in a made language specified by this
challenge.

Knowing the maps I've just send my robot to the exact spot using if statments 
in the made language.

The implementation required BFS or DFS algoritms.
